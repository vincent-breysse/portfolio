#### Oct 2019 – Mar 2020

Generalist game engine including support for graphics and physics with a convenient Unity-like OOP interface.  
This project contains the work I have done during my engine courses, and many other features I have worked on during my spare time.  

### Simple Albedo/Specular/Normal map based rendering

## Trym [C++, Vulkan, Personal project]
-------------------------------------------------------
#### Oct 2019 – Feb 2020

Trym is a graphics engine with focus on low-level graphics, performances and software architecture.  
The engine backend uses data-oriented design, whereas the front-end uses a more friendly Unity-like approach.  
The engine uses Tryl (which is one of my projects) as its core library : https://github.com/vincent-breysse/tryl

### Entity rendering using Phong lighting, Texturing and Shadowing

### Same as above with a Black and White Post Processing effect

# Tryl [C++, Personal project]
-------------------------------------------------------
#### Oct 2018 – Feb 2020

Tryl is my all-purpose library in which I do my best to produce high quality code.   
On my scale, this project is quite big. Here are some statistics about hand-written code:

It is intentionally kept large in order to face real-world difficulties. This project was very good at teaching me that implementing some features in a fresh code base has nothing to do with working in an environment carrying a certain past.  

The more the code base grows, the more the flaws in my code appear clearly. Trying to make my code passes the test of time was by biggest challenge here.
